Thus, back in July 2013 I chose fantastically reliable and fast web hosting (for different budgets) that have fabulous reputation – [HawkHost](https://researchasahobby.com/best-website-hosting-companies-fooling/reliable-web-hosting-recommend/#hawkhost-recommended) and [EuroVPS](https://researchasahobby.com/best-website-hosting-companies-fooling/reliable-web-hosting-recommend/#eurovps-recommended) for myself and my clients. And I still use them (in addition to these hosts, later I started using great value-for-money hosting: [A2Hosting](https://researchasahobby.com/best-website-hosting-companies-fooling/reliable-web-hosting-recommend/#a2hosting-recommended), [GeekStorage](https://researchasahobby.com/best-website-hosting-companies-fooling/reliable-web-hosting-recommend/#geekstorage-recommended) and some other hosts which you can find below with real-time monitoring charts).

## Shared, unmanaged and managed hosting for WordPress. At the bird’s-eye view

Speaking simply, **managed hosting** is the kind of host which simplifies or automates tasks for you when you maintain your website compared to a shared hosting or unmanaged hosting (think of command line). For example, managed WordPress hosts are the ones I review in this article.

**Unmanaged hosting** is the most skill-demanding and labor-intensive kind of hosting since it requires Linux skills. For example, [VPS hosting](https://researchasahobby.com/best-website-hosting-companies-fooling/reliable-web-hosting-recommend/#vps-dedi) or the hosts like [Digital Ocean](https://researchasahobby.com/go/digitalocean/) or [Linode](http://linode.com) fall into this category.

**Shared hosting** is much more user-friendly. This is the most popular kind of hosting for website owners (I’m sure you can name several shared hosts). There’s huge and saturated market of shared hosts and people struggle to choose a decent provider, but this is a [different topic](https://researchasahobby.com/best-website-hosting-companies-fooling/).

Shared hosting means you get some server resources (on a shared basis with many other users). Also you get a set of standard software (e.g. cPanel with some modules). It is sufficient so that you can install and maintain your website.

You can install additional plugins and use third-party services which simplify and automate the maintaining of your website. But you need to spend time to learn about all this stuff. Also, with shared or unmanaged host you bare _more risks_ of choosing a faulty plugin/service or using it incorrectly.

**Managed host takes the responsibility** of many standard tasks such as security, backups, additional tools for technical maintenance and development, performance improvement, monitoring etc.

**With unmanaged or shared hosting you have to do it yourself**. If you use WordPress, you have a lot of options since there is a wide variety of plugins and services (both free and paid) for it. But you need to educate yourself in order to choose them right and use them right.

_By the way, I have written a series of articles which cover the most important aspects of maintaining a WordPress website using a shared (and unmanaged) hosting. As well as the recommendations on choosing a hosting. You can find the list of the articles [here](https://researchasahobby.com/best-articles/)._

   
**Theoretically, from the first sight using an unmanaged or shared hosting is cheaper** compared to a managed hosting if you compare just the prices. Unmanaged or shared hosts offer its service starting from just several bucks per month.

**Whereas managed WordPress hosting** is significantly more expensive. Depending on server resources and the services included prices range from about $15/mo up to hundreds of dollars.

**However, from the perspective of a business owner** or a person who can evaluate the risks considering the cost of their time, using managed hosting is much more attractive in terms of final costs.



A2 costs 

![[Pasted image 20240612221314.png]]The reason is that A2 Hosting has basically the same flaw as SiteGround. I.e. it has very attractive prices for the first billing period. But the renewals are quite expensive.

Free migration from your previous host
Free SSH.
- off-site backups are not included by default in your plan.
-  A2 as a well-performing shared host which successfully manages a lot of clients
### [FlyWheel](https://researchasahobby.com/go/getflywheel/)
This is NOT a shared hosting – each site gets a dedicated server resources (powered by Google Cloud).
This is also a less expensive fully managed WordPress hosting compared to other fully managed solutions if you have few sites.

It is easy WP site (it isn't JewelryExchange :sweat_smile:). Average WP site migration to hosting provider is 8 hrs. 
I want to say that I didn't like Bluehost when I migrated the site to it (many nuances and Bluehost is way not best WP hosting). Will have a call with Vlad tomorrow. 

And honestly, I don't understand purpose of this migration:
Do client have problems with site loading on GoDaddy now? Vlad said we are in hurry  with migration, but what is a reason? 
Will he have more than 1 WP site? 
What monthly payment does he prefer do you think (now he pays 30$/mo for Bluehost )?

P.S> we can leave on
